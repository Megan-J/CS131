Task 1:
a) In this command, we are searching the entire filesystem for files in the directory /etc that we have access to. Any errors in this command should be written to the two.txt file. The output of this command is written to one.txt and two.txt.
b) one.txt contains files all in the path beginning with /etc that we have access to. Thus, these files are in side the directory /etc or subdirectories in this directory. two.txt contains errors that occurred while searching such as permission denied to certain paths.

The commands used to find this were find /etc -type f > one.txt 2> two.txt

Task 2:
Output of the command:    
     15 2006,Mar
     13 2014,Jul
     12 2014,Aug

As per the dataset, top 3 [month, year] with the most number of YouTube channels created were:
1. March, 2006 with 15 channels
2. July, 2014 with 13 channels
3. August, 2014 with 12 channels

The commands used to find this was: cut -d ',' -f 20-21 Global\ YouTube\ Statistics.csv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 3
	- The cut command will select portions of each line of a file and write them to standard output (the terminal). The -d parameter was used to specify the deliminer between text which is defined in the ','. The -f parameter was used to specify the fields that we want to select. Here we wanted to use 20-21 as the range of the fields since those specified the created_year and created_month columns. Global\ YouTube\ Statistics.csv was the file that we were selecting. The output is piped to the sort command.
	- The sort command is to sort the output of the cut command numerically and alphabetically.
	- The uniq command is to remove duplicates in the output of the sort command, through the pipe. The -c parameter is to add a count of the number of times the lines occurred in the sort command. 
	- We need to use sort again to sort the output of the uniq command. We want to sort by the numbers in the beginning of the lines with the -n parameter. We use the -r to reverse sort to sort by higher to lowest.
	- The head command is to only get the first 10 lines of the file so we don't need to load all the lines of the output.

Task 3:
Output of ps -u megansp24
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
2465618 ?        00:00:00 systemd
2465620 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)

2470816 pts/2    00:00:00 ps


Task 4b:
Output of the when the ps -u megansp24 command is executed after opening the file using vi on a separate terminal.
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
2465618 ?        00:00:00 systemd
2465620 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)

2471988 pts/2    00:00:00 vim
2472251 pts/4    00:00:00 ps

The second opened terminal is recorded in the listed processes that I own. The Process ID for the vim 2471988.

Task 4d:
Output of the command when vi is quit in the first terminal:
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
2465618 ?        00:00:00 systemd
2465620 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
2465626 ?        00:00:00 sshd
2465627 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
2471656 ?        00:00:00 sshd
2471657 pts/4    00:00:00 bash
2472329 pts/4    00:00:00 ps

The both terminals are recorded in the listed processes that I own. Since the text file was closed, the Process ID for vim is now gone from the second terminal's list of processes that are running that I own.

Task 5:

Output of ps aux | grep "systemd" | head -1

root           1  0.6  0.0 178560 18368 ?        Ss    2023 842:20 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deserialize 18

The init process in Linux is the first process to start when the IBM VM starts. This process will continue to run until the VM is shut down. The process ID for the init process is 1.

Task 6:
ps aux lists all processes that belong to other users and me. The ps command lists all process statuses. This command uses -a parameter to list out all processes and -u parameter for all other users and me. This command also uses the -x parameter to include other processes that are not associated with the current terminal session.
